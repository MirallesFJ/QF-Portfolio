    "### Section 2.1: The Binomial Branch Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest discrete-time model that captures the essential ingredients of a financial market:\n",
    "- **Randomness** (uncertain asset prices)\n",
    "- **Time value of money** (interest on risk-free investment)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Stock\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the stock price over one time step, from $t = 0$ to $t = \\Delta t$:\n",
    "- Starts at $s_1$\n",
    "- Moves to:\n",
    "  - $s_3$ with probability $p$ (up)\n",
    "  - $s_2$ with probability $1 - p$ (down)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions:\n",
    "- The stock is traded freely at price $s_1$, in unlimited quantity\n",
    "- No dividends, no transaction costs, and no holding penalties\n",
    "- The randomness is binary and explicitly defined by probabilities $p$ and $1 - p$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bond\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent the time value of money, we introduce a **cash bond**:\n",
    "- Pays a continuously compounded interest rate $r$\n",
    "- A bond worth $B_0$ at $t = 0$ grows deterministically to $B_0 \\cdot \\exp(r \\Delta t)$ at $t = \\Delta t$\n",
    "- Unlimited borrowing and lending are permitted at this rate\n",
    "\n",
    "With both assets:\n",
    "- The **stock** introduces market uncertainty\n",
    "- The **bond** offers deterministic growth\n",

    "### Payoff Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "Investors may want claims that depend on the stock’s outcome. Any such contract can be represented as a function $f$:\n",
    "- $f(2)$: payoff if the stock goes to $s_2$ (down)\n",
    "- $f(3)$: payoff if the stock goes to $s_3$ (up)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Forward Contract with Strike $k$\n",
    "The payoff function is:\n",
    "- $f(2) = s_2 - k$\n",
    "- $f(3) = s_3 - k$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflects the fact that, in a forward contract, the buyer agrees in advance to pay $k$ for the stock at maturity.  \n",
    "So if the stock ends up at $s_2$, the payoff is $s_2 - k$: the value of the stock minus what was promised.  \n",
    "Likewise, if the stock goes to $s_3$, the payoff is $s_3 - k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This sets up the foundation for **replicating portfolios** and **arbitrage-free pricing** in discrete-time models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Risk-Free Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question: **Which derivative payoffs can be replicated using stock and bond?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forward contracts can be replicated:\n",
    "  - Buy the stock at $s_1$\n",
    "  - Finance it by borrowing (selling bonds)\n",
    "  - At maturity, deliver the stock and receive $s_1 \\cdot \\exp(r \\Delta t)$\n",
    "  - This matches the forward payoff exactly, so its price must be $s_1 \\cdot \\exp(r \\Delta t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- For more general claims (functions $f$):\n",
    "  - We know their possible outcomes: $f(2)$ and $f(3)$\n",
    "  - And their expected value: $(1 - p)f(2) + p f(3)$\n",
    "  - But it's not clear yet whether they can be perfectly replicated with a stock–bond portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "This opens the core question of **which payoffs admit risk-free replication**, the foundation for no-arbitrage \n",
    "pricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bond-Only Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We can match the expected value of a derivative's payoff using bonds by calculating the PV of the expected payoff of the derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Price} = \\exp(-r \\Delta t) \\cdot \\left[(1 - p)f(2) + p f(3)\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But this only targets the **expected payoff**, not the actual outcomes $f(2)$ and $f(3)$.  \n",
    "It's just expectation pricing in disguise — not true replication.  \n",
    "As with forwards, this approach **fails to enforce** arbitrage-free pricing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Using both the stock and the bond, we can construct a portfolio to **exactly replicate** the payoff of any derivative defined by:\n",

    "- Sell or borrow the bond (if $\\psi > 0$)\n",

    "Any two-outcome derivative $f$ can be perfectly replicated using stock and bond.  \n",
